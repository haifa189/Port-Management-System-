# Port-Management-System
Port Management System using Java 
There are ports, and ships are sailing between them. Ships are carrying the
following types of containers: basic, heavy, refrigerated, liquid, and each of them should
be handled differently. Containers in a port can be loaded to ships, and, conversely, they
can be unloaded from a ship to port. Ships need a certain amount of fuel to sail from
one port to another.
